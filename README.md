**Problem (what patients and clinicians face today)**
Not enough clinicians, longer waits: The U.S. is on track for a shortage of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036 and a growing share of current doctors are nearing retirement age. New-patient appointment waits have climbed to 31 days on average across major metros (up 19% since 2022).
High call volume + long calls: Access is uneven, so people turn to virtual care and telehealth with nurse-led telehealth/triage lines that routinely handle large call volumes. However, these calls are not short. Surveys report that typical nurse triage calls run 11–16 minutes. In big systems, daily volume can spike from ~1,000 to 7,000 calls/day during peaks.
Half the calls don’t become appointments: Evidence shows that about 50% of primary-care call-center cases can be handled with self-care advice alone, meaning no visit is scheduled. This means that huge blocks of nurse time are used up with no booked visit.
Paying is stressful and opaque: Americans carry at least $220 billion in medical debt; millions owe over $1,000 and many delay or avoid care because of costs. Clinics struggle with no-shows, rescheduling, and collecting balances.
Result: people wait too long, worry about the bill, and bounce between apps. Clinicians lose time and revenue to no-shows, refunds, and payment follow-up.

**Solution (what VoiceDoc is)**
VoiceDoc is a voice-first telehealth experience that feels like booking a ride:
You talk to an AI assistant that listens, clarifies symptoms, and drafts a clean visit summary based on your synthesized vitals, medical history, and past lab results.
When you’re ready, you pre-authorize a capped amount for the visit: think “hold up to $50.”
After the visit, the clinician charges only what was used (say $35 with insurance copay) and the rest is instantly returned ($15).
If the clinician prefers traditional dollars, they can cash out to USD seamlessly.
Your Medical Passport (a privacy-preserving, portable record pointer) updates after each visit so future care picks up where you left off.

**The story (patient & clinic journey)**

Lets imagine what a possible patient and clinic journey can look like with our patient Maya and doctor Alvarez.

**Maya (patient)**
Ask: Maya opens VoiceDoc, taps the mic, and explains what’s wrong. The assistant summarizes in plain language and lists what a doctor will likely ask next. VoiceDoc will then prompt Maya to schedule an appointment.
Pre-authorize: With one tap, Maya pays a base appointment fee for the visit. She can pay with USD and Coinbase Onramp will convert it into USDC to be held in an Escrow account.
Visit: Instead of paperwork and payment hurdles, a clinician sees Maya immediately, reviews the concise summary, provides service and focuses on care not paperwork.
Settle: The visit costs less than the cap. Only the actual fee is captured and the remaining is returned instantly.
Takeaway: Maya gets a doctor-friendly summary and her Medical Passport updates with relevant medical record, prescription, or lab work updates so she won’t repeat her story.

**Dr. Alvarez (clinic)**
Before the visit: The patient’s funds are secured for today’s appointment, so the doctor can start on time without chasing payment.
After the visit: The clinic captures exactly the agreed fee in one click from the escrow account without manual refunds or awkward billing calls.
If needed: The clinic can cash out to USD on their side without extra steps using Coinbase offramp.
Records: A time-stamped visit summary reduces charting overhead and supports quality follow-ups. This record is minted onto the Medical Passport in the VoiceDoc app.

**Why it matters (benefits)**
For patients
Predictable cost (you see the cap first).
No surprise bills and instant refunds of unused funds.
Less friction: one place to talk, book, pay, and access your medical passport.
For clinicians
Fewer no-shows and faster starts because payment is secured before the visit.
Zero time on refunds and fewer back-office billing tasks.
Clear documentation handed to you, not typed from scratch.
For payers & systems
Cleaner authorization and settlement data in real time.
Lower leakage from abandoned payments and collections.
Better continuity as the Medical Passport reduces duplicate work.

**Why now**
Access pressure is growing (physician shortage up to 86k; 31-day average waits). 
Virtual care is mainstream (persistent monthly and annual use), but the payment moment is still fractured.
Families are cost-sensitive (hundreds of billions in medical debt), so “only pay what was used” is the trust feature telehealth has been missing.
